                Storage tanks are containers that hold liquids, compressed gases or mediums used for the short- or
                long-term storage of heat or cold. The term can be used for reservoirs, and for manufactured containers.
                These storage containers / tanks are made up of Mild steel and stainless steel. (Photo attached by the
                name of MS tank)

                    A pressure vessel is a container designed to hold gases or liquids at a pressure substantially
                    different from the ambient pressure. Design involves parameters such as maximum safe operating
                    pressure and temperature, safety factor, corrosion allowance and minimum design temperature (for
                    brittle fracture). Hydrostatic tests use water, but pneumatic tests use air or another gas.
                    Hydrostatic testing is preferred, because it is a safer method, as much less energy is released if a
                    fracture occurs during the test (water does not rapidly increase its volume when rapid
                    depressurization occurs, unlike gases like air, which fail explosively)
