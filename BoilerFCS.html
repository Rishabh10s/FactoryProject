                        Coal crusher is used as an ore crusher equipment and is employed for crushing coal. 
                        Coal crushing machine is employed for material reduction and processing
                        applications. In order to reduce wastage of solid unburnt fuel (Coal) coal 
                        crusher is installed. MHP Thermal do not only design this equipment but 
                        manufacture in its company premises. We have successfully installed coal 
                        crusher on various sites.

                    This heavy equipment is designed to make separation / filtration of crushed material
                    from fine dust to oversized products. The frame of vibration screen is mounted on 
                    springs and the vibrations are generated from an unbalanced flywheel. The design

                        A screw feeder or screw conveyor is a mechanism that uses a rotating helical screw

                        materials. MHP Thermal use MS (Mild steel) to manufacture the screw feeder and 
                        the design team ensures a specified amount of fuel to be travelled or move within
