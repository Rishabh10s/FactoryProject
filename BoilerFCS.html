                <h2>Coal Crusher</h2>
                <p>Coal crusher is used as an ore crusher equipment and is employed for crushing coal. 
                    Coal crushing machine is employed for material reduction and processing
                    applications. In order to reduce wastage of solid unburnt fuel (Coal) coal 
                    crusher is installed. MHP Thermal do not only design this equipment but 
                    manufacture in its company premises. We have successfully installed coal 
                    crusher on various sites.  </p>

                <h2>Vibrating screen</h2>
                <p>This heavy equipment is designed to make separation / filtration of crushed material
                    from fine dust to oversized products. The frame of vibration screen is mounted on 
                    springs and the vibrations are generated from an unbalanced flywheel. The design 
                    of  Vibration screen is not very complex but yes it do require some short of 
                    calculations, basic understanding of the vibration systems and experience too. 
                    MHP Thermal designers ensures first that the design is flawless and is as per 
                    customer satisfaction, so that quality can't be compromised.

                <h2>Screw Feeder</h2>
                <p> A screw feeder or screw conveyor is a mechanism that uses a rotating helical screw 
                    blade, called a "flighting", usually within a tube, to move liquid or granular 
                    materials. MHP Thermal use MS (Mild steel) to manufacture the screw feeder and 
                    the design team ensures a specified amount of fuel to be travelled or move within 
                    a certain time period. It becomes a bit challenging when it comes to the the 
                    manufacturing of screw blades "Flighting". But the skilled team handles this 
                    challenge well and have expertise not only in manufacturing but installation 
                    of the equipment too.</p>

                <p> MHP Thermal manufactures the conveyor which are used to take solid fuel from 
                    one point to other in the boiler house. A belt is wrapped over on the the 
                    rollers and is a powered up with a electric motor. We have successfully 
                    installed conveyors on various sites.

                <h2>Bucket Elevator</h2>
                <p>One of the most efficient ways to elevate bulk materials vertically is with. 
                    A Bucket Elevator consists of a series of buckets attached to a belt or chain 
                    with pulleys or sprockets located at the top and bottom of the unit. This 
                    equipment have its great advantage i.e. it can carry maximum of fuel from 
                    one point to other vertically.
