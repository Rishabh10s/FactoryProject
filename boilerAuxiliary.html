                <h2>Chimney</h2>
                <p>The chimney is a tall structure used to ventilate or exhaust off all gases
                    generated during the Combustion of Fuel. Although it may be self-supported
                    or supported by ropes, a huge structure made of steel or concrete but its
                    primary function is just to vent off poisonous or harmful gases at a height
                    where it does not come in contact with any human.</p>

                <h2>Air Pre-Heater</h2>
                <p>An air preheater (APH) is any device designed to heat air before another process
                    (for example, combustion in a boiler) with the primary objective of increasing
                    the thermal efficiency of the process. They may be used alone or to replace a
                    recuperative heat system or to replace a steam coil.

                <h2>Water Pre-Heater</h2>
                <p>A water pre-heater absorbs the flue gas heat into water thus, utilizing the heat
                    from the exhaust gas which would otherwise be wasted. Plant efficiency is therefore
                    further increased when viewed with respect to actual energy content of the fuel.</p>

                <p>ID fan is always located between dust collector and chimney. ID fan will take the hot
                    flue gases from furnace via dust collector (dust separation system or Fume Extraction
                    system) and will deliver to chimney. ID fan will handle the flue gases i.e. hot air.

                    smooth and uniform combustion of fuel. FD fan will produce the positive pressure
                    inside the system i.e. furnace.
