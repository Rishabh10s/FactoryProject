                <p>A bagfilter is an air pollution control device and dust collector that removes
                    particulates or gas released from commercial processes out of the air. Reducing 
                    the pollution has always been one of the motto of MHP Thermal.  We MHP Thermal, 
                    have successfully installed and commissioned Bag filters at various sites and has 
                    helped in protecting the environment.</p>
