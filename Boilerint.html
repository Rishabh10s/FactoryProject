                The main purpose of refractory material that is used inside a Boiler is to contain the heat generated by
                burning of the fuel in the furnace and to minimize heat losses from the furnace. It is therefore
                important that these materials have insulating properties and are able to withstand high temperatures.
                Also, the refractory to be used inside boiler furnace should not contaminate the material with which it
                is in contact.
                Boiler refractory material should have sufficient mechanical strength and be able to withstand various
                forces like High Temperature, sudden change in temperature, flue dust, weight of adjacent brickwork etc.
                The material (pure compounds) which are used to make refractory (like MgO, SiC, Fireclay etc.) have high
                melting point in range of 1800° to 2800 ° C. The refractory material must have one major property i.e.
                it should be able to expand and contract uniformly with temperature change without cracking.

                MHP Thermal do supply the refractory material for boiler furnace. The Refractory work is led by one
                other team of company. The team has successfully made boiler furnaces on several sites.

                    Insulation is a method of reducing the loss of heat from the steam pipe to the surroundings. Without
                    proper insulation , the amount of energy lost can be 10 times greater than the energy being
                    delivered. Insulating steam distribution lines can typically reduce energy losses by 90% and help
                    ensure proper steam pressure at plant equipment. Based on your plant or equipment the engineering
                    team can help you out in the installation of both Hot and cold insulation. Getting your Steam
                    pipeline Insulated will help you to handle up the plant efficiency as because the losses will
                    reduce, and as its result it will indirectly help you to save money, increase comfort or simply keep
                    your equipment running smoothly.

                    Boiler furnace is the region where the fuel is burnt and the boiler is getting heat energy for the steam
                    generation, but what to do if
                    the furnace is not capable of accumulating enough heat, that can convert water into steam
                    OR
                    because of continuous use since a long time the furnace refractory bricks has undergone cracking.
    
                    So in all such case the furnace need a to be repaired. MHP Thermal Engineering team is well skilled and
                    is accomplishing such tasks regularly in boiler houses of multiple company's of India.
